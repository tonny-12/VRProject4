The future generation. Parents are, without a doubt, holds the most significant impact on the life of a child. The future generation will be the new leaders and new innovators who change the world for the better. In order for them to grow and mature, as such, eating habits from their childhood is quite important in the development and health of thier body.\r\n\r\nIn this experience, the user will play the role of a child's parent. They will be able to pick from two items in each of the two choices which will affect the child's eating behaviour in the accelerated future of 5 years. The two decisions the user is presented with are:  \r\n1. Rewarding the child with food or playtime. (Cake/Toy)  \r\n2. Freedom for the child to eat or not eat food he dislikes. (Snack/Book)  \r\nBoth of these decisions will determine on how healthy the child is. See Scientific Data.\r\n\r\n### Source Code and APK\r\n[Android APK and Source Code](https://www.dropbox.com/s/zp5hpt0bel552qh/VRProject4.zip?dl=0)\r\n\r\n### Authors\r\n[Virada Long](https://github.com/ViradaLong)  \r\n[Jesse Trinity](https://github.com/jtrinity)  \r\n[Tonny Xie](https://github.com/tonny-12)  \r\n\r\n### YouTube Video\r\n[Demo](https://youtu.be/uczOzXVApc0)  \r\n\r\n### Website\r\nhttp://tonny-12.github.io/VRProject4/\r\n\r\n### Social Relevance\r\n\r\nChild rearing is an important social topic. Many people will be parents someday, and these parents shape the future generation in how they raise their children. Children themselves are highly impressionable at a young age, and how you are treated when you are young often follows you throughout the rest of your life. \r\n\r\n### Scientific Data\r\n\r\nThis project was based on a research paper named [\"If you are good you can have a cookie: How memories of childhood food rules link to adult eating behaviors\"](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/8679359_If_you_are_good_you_can_have_a_cookie_How_memories_of_childhood_food_rules_link_to_adult_eating_behaviors) by Rebecca M. Puhl and Marlene B. Schwartz of the Department of Psychology, Yale University. This study has shown through self-reported surveys that strict parental food rules, such as rewarding children with food is linked to higher weight and increased risk of binge eating. Similarly, punishing with food, such as forcing children to eat food they dislike, also has some correlation with eating disorders.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Empathy Evaluation\r\n\r\nTwo people took the Empathy Evaluation questionnaire before and after their experience with this project. In the questionnaire, the topics rotated between animal rights, environmentalism, tuition raise and food rewards, our topic. The table below reflects the averages from the pre-survey, post-survey and the difference between them.\r\n\r\n**Empathy Evaluation Results Table**  \r\n\r\nPerson 1:\r\n\r\n| Topic                    | Pre | Post | Diff |\r\n|--------------------------|-----|-----|-----|\r\n| Animal Rights            | 3.3 | 3   | -0.3|\r\n| Environmentalism         | 5.7 | 5.7 | 0   |\r\n| Tuition raise            | 2.7 | 3.3 | 0.6 |\r\n| Food Rewards             | 4   | 5   | 1   |\r\n\r\nPerson 2:\r\n\r\n| Topic                    | Pre | Post | Diff |\r\n|--------------------------|-----|-----|-----|\r\n| Animal Rights            | 2.6 | 2.3 | 0.3 |\r\n| Environmentalism         | 6   | 5.7 | -0.3|\r\n| Tuition raise            | 1.7 | 2   | 0.3 |\r\n| Food Rewards             | 2.3 | 4.7 | 2.4 |\r\n\r\nThe simulator sickness questionnaire yielded relatively good results with all the control results having a difference of less than one. The second person had a larger change in opinion than the first, but the topic of food rewards had the greatest change between the pre and post surveys for both people that took it.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--### Team Responsibilities-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Assets & Resources  \r\n[TV Furniture](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/60122) by Enozone   \r\n[Flatscreen TV](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/9721) by Rutger Klunder  \r\n[Wall TVset](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/8468) by 3d.rina\r\n[Props for the Classroom](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/5977) by VR  \r\n[Door](http://www.turbosquid.com/FullPreview/Index.cfm/ID/426247) by ahmet hamdi  \r\n[3D Bakery Object](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/17167) by Layer Lab  \r\n[Cute Little Cartoonish Fruits](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/48848) by Game Slyce  \r\n[Dish&Tray](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/5333) by Yuji Nagata  \r\n[Chairs and Sofas Pack](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/6411) by A World For Us  \r\n[Cartoon Car - Free](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/38743) by DooLabs (Marco Siino)  \r\n[Free Furniture Set](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/26678) by Lef  \r\n[Japanese-Style Series: Low Table Pack](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/39077) by MSTK Studio  \r\n[Models](https://charactergenerator.autodesk.com/) by Autodesk  \r\n[Animations](https://www.mixamo.com/) by mixamo  \r\n[Dialogue Box](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehmBIP5sj0M) by gamesplusjames\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n# VR-Project3: Mount Everest\r\nIn this project, collective data on Mount Everest is shown to the users in virtual reality.\r\n\r\n### Website\r\nhttp://cfkwok.github.io/VR-Project3\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13974892/14173579/ab6cc0d2-f70c-11e5-98d0-337685971275.png)\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13974892/14173604/ddd4a45e-f70c-11e5-8be2-d0f96647a9e7.png)\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13974892/14173618/f74040b0-f70c-11e5-990e-17ccc2655566.png)\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13974892/14173639/150277a8-f70d-11e5-9b4e-6313ee28aa53.png)\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13974892/14173653/3f17e140-f70d-11e5-9cbb-2cbeb3befa74.png)\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13974892/14173912/f3fbd98a-f70e-11e5-8107-160874aeb9a2.png)\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13974892/14173925/0121d72c-f70f-11e5-89a5-fcf89bda866b.png)\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13974892/14173934/104feaea-f70f-11e5-9396-e2b6e7605e80.png)\r\n\r\n### Motivation and Explanation\r\nPresented with the idea of representing data in VR, our group came to plan the design of an interesting crossroads of data sources. The Everest VR experience we have designed allows users to live in a combination of various data. First, and most obvious, is the actual terrain that users will walk on. The terrain is derived from heightmap data which has been imported and rebuilt in-engine to be explored first hand. For the sake of attempting to keep people within typically traversed trails, we have included in a heads-up display a couple bits of information, including the current trail and a compass to direct the user to pre-defined waypoints, which updates to point to the subsequent waypoint as you arrive at each. Additionally, we have included, to augment the experience, accurate time and weather data from Everest. Information about the current weather is also included in the heads-up display, including time, wind speed, and rain/snow intensity. All weather is additionally represented visually, including implementation of a day-night cycle as well as independent snow and rain systems that trigger according to the recorded intensity of the weather. All time (and its corresponding weather) data is represented on a minute-by-minute resolution, at a rate of one minute simulated per one second of real time. Finally, we have also included in the experience, a small number of mini-episodes representing common fatality data.\r\n\r\nTo allow users to experience more data in a compact span of time, we have also provided a number of manipulation tools to help them move through the data. Implemented are “teleports,” some of which allow users to physically teleport to a subsequent or previous waypoint. Other features of the teleport system allow users to teleport through time either forward or backward (while remaining in the same location), both on an hourly resolution and by larger segments of time, shifting users to either morning, evening, overnight time slots. Following either style of teleport, users will instantly resume the progression of the experience. All of these different types of teleports can be combined in a variety of ways to experience all permutations of each type of data we have included in the Everest VR project.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Insight Objective\r\nThe compiled data we have on Mount Everest will give the users an experience of what the climate one should expect at different elevations, the dangers and fatalities that occurred in the ascent, and easy-to-access campsites along the North-Col and South-Col routes of Everest within virtual reality. The use of VR leverages a better understanding of the altitudes of campsites along the routes, clearer insight of the weather expressed in that setting, and an immersed scare about the dangers of performing the ascent.\r\n\r\n### Gaining Insight into the Data\r\n**Predict two major insights participants will gain:**  \r\n1. The beauty and magnitude of Mount Everest.  \r\n2. The difficult journey to the top of Mount Everest.\r\n\r\n**Person 1:**  \r\nKnowledge on Mount Everest   \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"Highest peak in the world?\"  \r\nInsights Gained After VR Experience  \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"Mount Everest highest peak is approximately 24000-25000 feet\"  \r\n\r\n**Person 2:**  \r\nKnowledge on Mount Everest  \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"Tallest mountain in the world.\"  \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"Many people die climbing it.\"  \r\nInsights Gained After VR Experience  \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"I felt like I was standing at the peak of Mount Everest.\"  \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"I learned that there were only 5000 to reach the peak.\"  \r\n\r\n**Person 3:**  \r\nKnowledge on Mount Everest  \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"Huge mountain of snow.\"   \r\nInsights Gained After VR Experience  \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"47 people died from avalanche.\"  \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"Beautiful scene at the top of the mountain.\"  \r\n\r\nBefore going through the experience, all three people ([1], [2], [3]) have very common knowledge of Mount Everest's immense size. After the experience, our prediction of, \"The beauty and magnitude of Mount Everest.\" was the more common insight the three individuals grasped. [1] gained insight on what the elevation of Mount Everest is at the peak, and [2] and [3] reported on the beautiful scenery of the mountain's peak. Although our second prediction, \"The difficult journey to the top of Mount Everest.\", was not as common, [2] and [3] alluded to the \"difficult journey\". [2] used the word \"only\" to describe his insight on how many people successfully ascended to the top of Mount Everest. This can be interpreted as his surprise to the fewer number of summiters than he expected. [3] learned how many people died from an avalanche, but simply reported the information rather than seeing it as part of the difficult journey.  \r\n\r\n**Kennedy Simulator Sickness Questionnaire**  \r\n\r\n|                          | [1] | [2] | [3] |\r\n|--------------------------|-----|-----|-----|\r\n| General Discomfort       | 1   | 2   | 1   |\r\n| Fatigue                  | 0   | 1   | 0   |\r\n| Boredom                  | 1   | 1   | 1   |\r\n| Drowsiness               | 0   | 0   | 0   |\r\n| Headache                 | 0   | 2   | 0   |\r\n| Eyestrain                | 0   | 1   | 0   |\r\n| Difficulty Focusing      | 0   | 0   | 0   |\r\n| Salivation Increase      | 0   | 0   | 0   |\r\n| Sweating                 | 0   | 0   | 0   |\r\n| Nausea                   | 0   | 0   | 0   |\r\n| Difficulty Concentrating | 0   | 0   | 0   |\r\n| Mental Depression        | 0   | 0   | 0   |\r\n| \"Fullness of the Head\"   | 0   | 0   | 0   |\r\n| Blurred Vision           | 0   | 0   | 0   |\r\n| Dizziness Eyes Open      | 0   | 0   | 0   |\r\n| Vertigo                  | 0   | 0   | 0   |\r\n| Visual Flashbacks        | 0   | 0   | 0   |\r\n| Faintness                | 0   | 0   | 0   |\r\n| Aware of Breathing       | 0   | 0   | 0   |\r\n| Stomach Awareness        | 0   | 0   | 0   |\r\n| Loss of Appetite         | 0   | 0   | 0   |\r\n| Increased Appetite       | 0   | 0   | 0   |\r\n| Desire to Move Bowels    | 0   | 0   | 0   |\r\n| Confusion                | 0   | 0   | 0   |\r\n| Burping                  | 0   | 0   | 0   |\r\n| Vomiting                 | 0   | 0   | 0   |\r\n| Total                    | 2   | 7   | 2   |\r\n\r\nThe simulator sickness questionnaire yielded relatively good results with an average of 3. [2] had a much higher total than the other two participants because the Google Cardboard did not fit comfortably on him which probably resulted in headache and eyestrain. [1] and [3] did report a discomfort in wearing the headset, but this did not cause any notable sickness to them. A major factor in these results are most likely due to the weight of the phone being used in the Cardboard. The phone is slightly larger than most phones causing the Cardboard to tilt forward and would rely only on the user's nose to support much of the weight.\r\n\r\n### Research\r\n[Summiter Data](http://www.8000ers.com/cms/download.html?func=startdown&id=152)  \r\n[Fatality Data](http://www.8000ers.com/cms/en/download.html?func=fileinfo&id=171)  \r\n[Weather Data](http://www.mountain-forecast.com/peaks/Mount-Everest/forecasts/8850)  \r\n\r\n### Assets & Resources\r\n[Rain Maker Asset](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/34938) by Digital Ruby, LLC  \r\n[Day/Night Cycle Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5GFoI38DOg) by Glen Rhodes  \r\n[Tents Model](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/21461) by VIS Games  \r\n[Breath Sound](https://www.freesound.org/people/The%20Baron/sounds/98397/) by The Baron  \r\n[Mount Everest Heightmap](http://terrain.party/) by terrain.party  \r\n[Heightmap Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vyNbalvXR4) by HelloWorldStudios  \r\n[Humanoid Models](https://www.mixamo.com/) by mixamo  \r\n-->\r\n",
