<a id="motivation--explanation" class="anchor" href="#motivation--explanation" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Motivation &amp; Explanation</h3>

<p>Presented with the challenge of creating an accelerated future in VR, the group decided to do a project on one of the most important aspects of human life. The future generation. Parents are, without a doubt, holds the most significant impact on the life of a child. The future generation will be the new leaders and new innovators who change the world for the better. In order for them to grow and mature, as such, eating habits from their childhood is quite important in the development and health of thier body.</p>

<p>In this experience, the user will play the role of a child's parent. They will be able to pick from two items in each of the two choices which will affect the child's eating behaviour in the accelerated future of 5 years. The two decisions the user is presented with are:<br>
1. Rewarding the child with food or playtime. (Cake/Toy)<br>
2. Freedom for the child to eat or not eat food he dislikes. (Snack/Book)<br>
Both of these decisions will determine on how healthy the child is. See Scientific Data.</p>

<p>Child rearing is an important social topic. Many people will be parents someday, and these parents shape the future generation in how they raise their children. Children themselves are highly impressionable at a young age, and how you are treated when you are young often follows you throughout the rest of your life. </p>

<a id="scientific-data" class="anchor" href="#scientific-data" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Scientific Data</h3>

<p>This project was based on a research paper named <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/8679359_If_you_are_good_you_can_have_a_cookie_How_memories_of_childhood_food_rules_link_to_adult_eating_behaviors">"If you are good you can have a cookie: How memories of childhood food rules link to adult eating behaviors"</a> by Rebecca M. Puhl and Marlene B. Schwartz of the Department of Psychology, Yale University. This study has shown through self-reported surveys that strict parental food rules, such as rewarding children with food is linked to higher weight and increased risk of binge eating. Similarly, punishing with food, such as forcing children to eat food they dislike, also has some correlation with eating disorders.</p>

<a id="empathy-evaluation" class="anchor" href="#empathy-evaluation" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Empathy Evaluation</h3>

<p>Two people took the Empathy Evaluation questionnaire before and after their experience with this project. In the questionnaire, the topics rotated between animal rights, environmentalism, tuition raise and food rewards, our topic. The table below reflects the averages from the pre-survey, post-survey and the difference between them.</p>

<p>The simulator sickness questionnaire yielded relatively good results with all the control results having a difference of less than one. The second person had a larger change in opinion than the first, but the topic of food rewards had the greatest change between the pre and post surveys for both people that took it.</p>
